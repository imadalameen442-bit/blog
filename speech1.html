        <h2>Speech Recording</h2>
        <p><strong>3 Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The speech was relatable to the class (my audience), specifically the last part in which I talked about everyone’s journey..</li>
  <li>I connected my object to my speech very well, and I am happy that I didn’t do it in a way that would distract me or take too much of my actual speech.</li>
  <li>I liked the way I prepared for the speech. I did so by simply remembering the points I wanted to talk about and rehearsing it multiple times with myself. The words were more or less on the spot, but they conveyed the same meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3 Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>At 1:00 I had said “uhh but y’know”, and I did so multiple times along with other unnecessary phrases such as “I ahhh…” or “ Or whatever”.</li>
  <li>I looked up or to the side a bit too much, and I did this throughout the speech. I need to look at my audience a bit more.</li>
  <li>At 0:40 and 1:48 I say clicks, but I realize now I never really fully explained how clicks represent “figuring something out”. I do think the audience understood that but I should have made it more clear.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Intoductory Speech Reflection</h2>

        <p>
For my first speech, I believe I did well overall, though there is still much I can improve. The preparation process started unexpectedly. 
I was sitting in my room, fidgeting with my Rubik’s Cube, when the idea suddenly came to me: I should build my speech around the cube. 
More specifically, I wanted it to represent my mind.
</p>

<p>
Instead of starting with a formal outline, I began by practicing in front of a mirror and speaking freely. I developed my outline as I rehearsed. 
Whenever I didn’t like how something sounded, I would pause, go back, and rephrase it until it felt right. This helped me avoid memorizing exact words. 
Instead, I focused on understanding the ideas behind my speech so I could speak more naturally.
</p>

<p>
I organized my speech using key “points” rather than memorized lines. Point one was the introduction, where I greeted the audience and connected the Rubik’s Cube to my mind. 
Point two provided context, where I spoke about my struggles as a younger child and compared my mind to others at the time. 
Point three focused on memorization, using the example of how my parents taught me Arabic. 
Point four described learning new processes, specifically how I developed better comprehension skills in middle school. 
Point five addressed my SUPA hardships, particularly how difficult analysis was at first, and I began connecting my experiences to those of the audience. 
Finally, point six was my favorite. It was where I explained that everyone has a unique mind, and each of us must go on our own journey to unscramble the “Rubik’s Cube” within ourselves.
</p>

<p>
My favorite moment in the speech was near the end, at 4:40, when I said, “I am not going to fully finish this cube.” 
This symbolized that we are all still growing and learning, and none of our minds are fully complete yet. 
I was also proud that the cube itself did not distract me. Initially, I worried I might focus too much on it, but I stayed focused on speaking clearly and delivering my message. 
Another strength was that I projected my voice well and spoke clearly throughout most of the speech.
</p>

<p>
However, there were weaknesses. Around 1:00 and in several other places, I used filler words such as “uhh,” “I ahhh,” and “of some sort.” 
These did not add value and instead weakened my delivery. I also noticed that I often looked to the side or at the ceiling. 
Maintaining consistent eye contact with the audience is something I need to improve. Additionally, at 0:40 and 1:48, I referenced “clicks,” but I did not fully explain how those clicks represented moments of understanding. 
While the audience likely understood the idea, I could have made it clearer.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I believe I achieved my main goal for this speech. I wanted to gauge my current speaking ability, experiment with preparation techniques, and learn how to improve. 
The rehearsal method I used helped me discover better ways to express my ideas. For example, the ending, where I connected the cube to everyone in the audience, was not part of my original plan. 
It developed naturally through practice.
</p>

<p>
For my next speech, my goals are clear: reduce filler words, maintain stronger eye contact, and become more confident. 
This speech showed me that growth comes through both preparation and reflection, just like solving a Rubik’s Cube.
