    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Imad Al-Ameen. I have newly enrolled in a communications course, 
      as I plan to learn how to be able to give speeches to people, 
      and even learn how to talk better in professional instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog allows me to document my learning over time while also engaging
      personally with the material beyond the classroom. I also get to code which is a personal hobby of mine.

    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
        I am a student at Henninger High School, dual enrolled via SUPA at Syracuse University,
        where I am currently a senior graduating and planning on enrolling at Syracuse University.
        Outside of academics, I enjoy coding, gaming, and exploring new technologies. I also lifeguard for a job, and volunteer at Crouse Medical Hospital.
