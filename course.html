    <h1>The CRS SUPA Course</h1>
    <p>
      I am posting about the Public Speaking course in order to document my progress throughout it. This course seems very interesting but also a bit difficult.
      I am definitly most concerned about the quizzes we have to take, as I was never a good test taker. I feel confident in my ability to give speeches, but I do
      worry I might talk <em>too</em> much! For my first assignment, I have to curate a speech that is tied to both myself and an object that has some sort of meaning to me.
      I am thinking of using a rubics cube, to showcase how my mind works. How that rather than just reading boring long texts, I rather engage myself with a puzzle in a sense.
      You can even tell, I mean I <em>am</em> coding this blog right now!
      My goal is to get better at public speaking, and be able to give speeches in front of a crowd without getting nervous. I also want the ability to organize
      my thoughts and think on the spot better in order to be more professional and ready for college next year. My largest goal for the course is to learn the best ways to 
      convey my message effectively, perhaps even get an audience to act on it. I think I will know if I reach this judging from my audience (the class) or my teacher's reactions.
